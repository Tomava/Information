# Information

Some more information on the projects in my GitHub.

All of the projects were created because I wanted to have some utility and wanted to learn programming by creating them by myself. 

## [Pytris](https://github.com/Tomava/Pytris)

In this project I used and learned about classes and class inheritance in Python quite a bit. The classes could however be used a bit more optimally than what they currently are. Also, Pygame-library became familiar as well as some game design concepts.

## [DailyNotifier](https://github.com/Tomava/DailyNotifier)

This project taught me more about APIs and automatic web page scaping as well as some regular expression and HTML on the way. Also handling API-keys and using *.env* file to store them and not add them to version control. The project is nicely organized and easy to edit later on. Beautifulsoup-library could have been used instead of regex to read pages.

## [Minesweeper](https://github.com/Tomava/Minesweeper)

This was originally a self-selected and designed school project, but I made quite a few improvements after finishing the course. The structure of the code could be made a bit clearer as some functions are multipurposed in somewhat confusin ways. 

This project thought Tkinter.

## [TelegramBot](https://github.com/Tomava/CryptoTrackerBot)

This project taught about usage of APIs and requests, and I utilized matplotlib-library that I had used quite a lot at the time to create different graphs.

## [DiscordBot](https://github.com/Tomava/HelperBot)

This was originally the first real project I made with Python, and I was just starting out as programmer as well. However, the original project did not utilize git and was poorly structured, so I rewrote the whole code which is this project.

In this project I learned about asynchronous functions, working with JSON-files, saving stuff to disk and discord.py-library. This was also one of the first times I utilized organizing code into different files. The organization is OK, but file naming could be better. Also, a reminder-class would benefit the code a lot.

## [Ledivilkutin](https://github.com/Tomava/Ledivilkutin)

This project came from a desire to automate creation of tedious code for an embedded electronic on one of the first courses in university. I also learned how multiple components, inputter and the main functionality, can work together.

It taught about pysimplegui-library and making an undo-functionality even though it could be handled much better and not with dictionaries.

## [Pairs](https://github.com/Tomava/Pairs_GUI)

This was also originally a school project of which I improved afterwards. I learned more about C++ as well as created a Python-code that created randomized colors for the cards.
