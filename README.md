# Information

Some more information on the projects in my GitHub.

All of the projects were created because I wanted to have some utility and wanted to learn programming by creating them by myself.

Lately I've been adding and updating the use of Docker on many of the projects.

## Python

### [Pytris](https://github.com/Tomava/Pytris)

In this project I used and learned about classes and class inheritance in Python quite a bit. The classes could however be used a bit more optimally than what they currently are. Also, Pygame-library became familiar as well as some game design concepts.

### [DailyNotifier](https://github.com/Tomava/DailyNotifier)

This project taught me more about APIs and automatic web page scaping as well as some regular expression and HTML on the way. Also handling API-keys and using *.env* file to store them and not add them to version control. The project is nicely organized and easy to edit later on. Beautifulsoup-library could have been used instead of regex to read pages.

### [Minesweeper](https://github.com/Tomava/Minesweeper)

This was originally a self-selected and designed school project, but I made quite a few improvements after finishing the course. The structure of the code could be made a bit clearer as some functions are multipurposed in somewhat confusin ways. 

This project taught Tkinter.

### [TelegramBot](https://github.com/Tomava/CryptoTrackerBot)

This project taught about usage of APIs and requests, and I utilized matplotlib-library that I had used quite a lot at the time to create different graphs.

### [DiscordBot](https://github.com/Tomava/HelperBot)

This was originally the first real project I made with Python, and I was just starting out as programmer as well. However, the original project did not utilize git and was poorly structured, so I rewrote the whole code which is this project.

In this project I learned about asynchronous functions, working with JSON-files, saving stuff to disk and discord.py-library. This was also one of the first times I utilized organizing code into different files. The organization is OK, but file naming could be better. Also, a reminder-class would benefit the code a lot.

### [Ledivilkutin](https://github.com/Tomava/Ledivilkutin)

This project came from a desire to automate creation of tedious code for an embedded electronic on one of the first courses in university. 

It taught about pysimplegui-library and making an undo-functionality even though it could be handled much better and not with dictionaries. I also learned how multiple components, inputter and the main functionality, can work together.

### [TemperatureMonitor](https://github.com/Tomava/TemperatureMonitor)

This project's goal was to monitor and visualize the temperature inside and outside. This was the first project where I used sensors in IoT. Although, the measuremenet were simple to take with a python library.

The frontend part is still on very early steps, but the backend and data collection is fully implemented. The data is collected to CSV-files for easier manual viewing, but a database could be added later on.

From this project, I learned some things about Flask library and I hope to learn some more about how to graph data on the frontend.

## C++

### [Pairs](https://github.com/Tomava/Pairs_GUI)

This was also originally a school project of which I improved afterwards. I learned more about C++ as well as created a Python-code that created randomized colors for the cards.

## Javascript

### [Full stack open 2022](https://github.com/Tomava/FullStackOpen)

When I started this course I had no experience with Javascript but I gathered a lot of knowledge about it during the course. React, NodeJs and MongoDB became familiar as well. These skills were then used in a university course in a real software project where I mostly used NodeJS and also learned Typescript.
